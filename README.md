What I Did
Installed vulnerability scanning tools:  Nessus Essentials.

Configured the scan target to my local machine.

Performed full vulnerability scans to detect security weaknesses.

Analyzed scan reports to identify vulnerabilities and their severity levels.

Researched simple fixes and mitigations for the most critical vulnerabilities found.

Documented key vulnerabilities with descriptions and recommended solutions.

Captured screenshots of scan setup, progress, and final reports for reference.

This project helped me understand how to detect and assess security vulnerabilities and apply practical remediation steps to enhance system security.
